# 8 Puzzle Solver
By [Sabaipon Phimmala](https://github.com/bphimmala) and [Emily Hix](https://github.com/emilyhix)

The 8 Puzzle Solver utilizes Uniform Cost Search and A* search algorithm with differing heuristics. A* specifically uses either Misplaced Tile heuristic or Euclidean DIstance heuristic.

The implementation was completed in C++ with an object-oriented design.
